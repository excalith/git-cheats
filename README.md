**Git Cheats** is a small project for people who wants to get into git using commands but don't know where to start. It started as a side-project to help my friends / colleagues check commands easily, but it turned out it has been shared through my friends lots of times and it is being used on a daily basis. Suprising enough, I wanted to create a repository for this. Maybe someone finds it useful and / or wants to contribute!

### GitCheats App [(Link)](http://gitcheats.com)
A simple web-based app where you can filter out commands in need easily.

### GitCheats CLI [(Link)](https://github.com/excalith/Git-Cheats-Cli)
A CLI app as a companion to GitCheats to fetch and retrieve commands right into your beloved terminal.
