# Git Cheats - *Cheatsheet For Git Commands*
**Git Cheats** is a small project for people who wants to get into git using commands but don't know where to start. It started as a side-project to help my friends / colleagues check commands easily, but it turned out it has been shared through my friends lots of times and it is being used on a daily basis. Suprising enough, I wanted to create a repository for this. Maybe someone finds it useful and / or wants to contribute!
