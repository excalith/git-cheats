## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Git Cheats Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How Can I Contribute?
### Reporting Bugs
Before creating bug reports, please perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/excalith/git-cheats/issues) to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out [the required template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.


### Suggesting Enhancements
Before suggesting an enhancement, please perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/excalith/git-cheats/issues) to see if the suggestion has already been submitted.

* **User a clear descriptive title** for the suggestion
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why
* **Do not request complicated commands** since this project is to help people get the basic commands

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues](https://github.com/excalith/git-cheats/labels/beginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/excalith/git-cheats/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.


### Pull Requests
While creating a Pull Request, fill out the [the required template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

* **Do not** change design into a complicated and / or overwhelming experience
* **Do not** include issue numbers in the PR title if any
* **Include** screenshots or animated GIFs in your pull request if a new feature


### Commit Messages
* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
